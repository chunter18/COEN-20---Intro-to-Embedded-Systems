# COEN-20---Intro-to-Embedded-Systems
Lab submissions and assignments for my Intro to Computer Organization and Embedded Systems class, fall 2017

All the functions are written in ARM assembly, intended to be called from a main C program. In each folder you will find the lab assignment .pdf file, the supplied main program (written by my proffesor, Dr. Lewis) and my .s file containing my solution. All the .s files are heavily commented for ease of understanding. 

The board we used for this lab is the STM32F429I-DISC1 board from STM, and all the code was originally written using the free EMBitz software.
